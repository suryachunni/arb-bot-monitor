# ⏰ AWAITING TELEGRAM VERIFICATION

## ✅ FINAL FIX APPLIED!

---

## 🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED:

### **Formula Inversion:**
```javascript
BEFORE (wrong):
price = amountOut / amountIn
= 3.2 WETH / 10,000 USDC
= 0.00032 → Showed as $0.00 ❌

AFTER (correct):
price = amountIn / amountOut
= 10,000 USDC / 3.2 WETH  
= 3,125 → Shows as $3,125.00 ✅
```

## 📊 WHAT TO VERIFY:

When you receive your next Telegram alert:

### **1. Check WETH Price:**
```
Bot shows: $3,000-3,200
CoinGecko ETH: ~$3,140
Match? ✅ = Working!
```

### **2. Check ARB Price:**
```
Bot shows: $0.75-0.85
CoinGecko ARB: ~$0.79
Match? ✅ = Working!
```

### **3. Check Consistency:**
```
WETH on all DEXs: Similar prices (~$3,145 ± $2)
Small differences = Normal arbitrage
No more wild 100X+ differences!
```

---

## 🔥 SUMMARY OF ALL FIXES:

### **Fix #1: Price Calculation**
Added price calculation to both functions

### **Fix #2: Price Normalization**
Changed all pairs to use USDC as token0

### **Fix #3: Formula Inversion**  ← FINAL FIX!
Changed `amountOut / amountIn` to `amountIn / amountOut`

**Result: Should now show realistic USD prices!**
