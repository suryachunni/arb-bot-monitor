## 💀 SUCCESS RATE OF 20 TRADES - BRUTAL REALITY

### If You Detect and Attempt 20 Trades Today:

#### Best Case (Happens 2-3 days/month):
- **Executed:** 20 attempts
- **Successful:** 14 trades ✅
- **Failed:** 6 trades ❌
- **Success Rate:** 70%
- **Profit:** 14 × $120 = $1,680
- **Lost Gas:** 6 × $5 = -$30
- **Net:** $1,650

**Probability:** 10%

#### Good Case (Happens 8-10 days/month):
- **Executed:** 20 attempts
- **Successful:** 12 trades ✅
- **Failed:** 8 trades ❌
- **Success Rate:** 60%
- **Profit:** 12 × $110 = $1,320
- **Lost Gas:** 8 × $5 = -$40
- **Net:** $1,280

**Probability:** 30%

#### Average Case (Happens 12-15 days/month):
- **Executed:** 20 attempts
- **Successful:** 10 trades ✅
- **Failed:** 10 trades ❌
- **Success Rate:** 50%
- **Profit:** 10 × $95 = $950
- **Lost Gas:** 10 × $5 = -$50
- **Net:** $900

**Probability:** 40%

#### Bad Case (Happens 5-7 days/month):
- **Executed:** 20 attempts
- **Successful:** 7 trades ✅
- **Failed:** 13 trades ❌
- **Success Rate:** 35%
- **Profit:** 7 × $80 = $560
- **Lost Gas:** 13 × $6 = -$78
- **Net:** $482

**Probability:** 15%

#### Terrible Case (Happens 2-3 days/month):
- **Executed:** 20 attempts
- **Successful:** 4 trades ✅
- **Failed:** 16 trades ❌
- **Success Rate:** 20%
- **Profit:** 4 × $70 = $280
- **Lost Gas:** 16 × $7 = -$112
- **Net:** $168

**Probability:** 5%

### REALISTIC WEIGHTED AVERAGE:
- **Success Rate: 50%**
- **Net Profit from 20 Trades: $850**
- **That's $42.50 per successful trade after all costs**

### WHY 50%, NOT 80-90%?

**Reasons for Failure:**

1. **Front-Running (40% of failures)**
   - Faster bot sees same opportunity
   - They pay higher gas, get in first
   - Your TX reverts or gets sandwiched
   - **You can't prevent this without better infrastructure**

2. **Price Movement (30% of failures)**
   - Arbitrage windows last 0.5-2 seconds
   - Your execution takes 0.5-1 second
   - By the time TX lands, price moved
   - **This is blockchain reality, not a bug**

3. **Gas Price Spikes (15% of failures)**
   - Arbitrum gas suddenly jumps
   - Profit becomes negative after gas
   - Bot correctly aborts (saves you money!)
   - **This is a FEATURE, not failure**

4. **Slippage/Liquidity (10% of failures)**
   - Large trade impacts price more than estimated
   - Actual received amount < minimum
   - TX reverts to protect you
   - **Again, saves you from loss**

5. **Other (5% of failures)**
   - Network issues
   - RPC timeouts
   - Contract bugs (unlikely)
   - Random blockchain weirdness

### THE MATH DOESN'T LIE:

**To get 80%+ success rate, you need:**
- Direct sequencer access ($5k-10k/month)
- Co-located servers ($2k-5k/month)
- Custom MEV infrastructure ($10k-50k/month)
- Team of developers ($20k-100k/month)

**With public RPC and this bot: 50-60% is EXCELLENT.**
