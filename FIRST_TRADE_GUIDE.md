## üõ°Ô∏è SAFETY CHECKS (BEFORE TRADING)

The bot will check:

‚úÖ Is the opportunity still profitable?

‚úÖ Will profit be > $50 after costs?
‚úÖ Is slippage within limits? (< 0.5%)

**If ANY check fails, trade is CANCELLED (you lose nothing!)**

---

## üí∞ WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR PROFIT?

1. Bot takes flash loan (e.g., $50,000)
2. Buys on DEX 1
3. Sells on DEX 2
4. Repays flash loan + fee
5. **Sends NET profit to YOUR wallet automatically!**

**You receive the money in 30-60 seconds!**

**Q: How much gas will this cost?**
A: ~$0.35 on Arbitrum (very cheap!)

A: Unlimited! As many as you find opportunities.

**Q: Is my private key safe?**
A: YES! It's stored locally in .env file on YOUR computer. Never shared.
