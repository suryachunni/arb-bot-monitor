### **Step 2: Upload Bot Files**

### **Step 2: Add Environment Variables**

While it's building:

Add these one by one:

```
PRIVATE_KEY = your_private_key_here
ARBITRUM_RPC_URL = https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = 7990738699:AAFfoPA4VGO_90DyQauHNiwbHnfwOTmfbgU
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID = 8305086804

3. Value: (your actual value)
4. Click **"Add"**
5. Repeat for all 8 variables

### **Step 3: Deploy Contract**

**IMPORTANT:** We need to deploy the smart contract first!

I'll include this in the template repository! ‚úÖ

2. Click **"Logs"** tab
