# 🔍 PRICE ANALYSIS - ROOT CAUSE FOUND!

## 🐛 THE REAL PROBLEM:

**Prices NOT changing even with 0.1 token:**
- WETH: $3994 (consistent across scans)
- ARB: $0.33 (consistent across scans)
- This means: NOT a slippage issue!

**Root Cause: WRONG POOLS!**

On Arbitrum, the main liquidity pools are:
- ✅ WETH/USDC (best liquidity)
- ❌ ARB/USDC (poor liquidity!)
- ❌ GMX/USDC (poor liquidity!)
- ❌ LINK/USDC (poor liquidity!)

Most tokens pair with WETH, not USDC!

---

## ✅ THE SOLUTION:

**Use 2-step pricing:**

1. **Get WETH price from WETH/USDC** (best liquidity)
2. **Get other tokens from TOKEN/WETH pools**
3. **Calculate USD price: TOKEN price in WETH × WETH price in USD**

Example:
```
ARB/WETH pool: 1 ARB = 0.000252 WETH
WETH/USDC pool: 1 WETH = $3,140
ARB USD price = 0.000252 × $3,140 = $0.79 ✅
```

This is MORE complex but uses REAL high-liquidity pools!

## 📲 I NEED YOUR DECISION:

**Option 1: Simple but inaccurate (current)**
- Use TOKEN/USDC pools directly
- Faster, simpler code
- But prices are WRONG due to low liquidity pools

**Option 2: Complex but accurate**
- Use WETH/USDC + TOKEN/WETH pools
- 2-step calculation
- Accurate prices using high-liquidity pools
- More code complexity

**Which do you prefer?**

---

**OR: Should I just focus on the ONE token with best liquidity (WETH) and show you that it's working correctly, then you can decide if you want to continue?**
