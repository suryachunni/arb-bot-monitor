## ⚙️ CONFIGURATION

All settings are in `.env`:

```bash
# Scanning interval (2 minutes)
SCAN_INTERVAL_MS=120000

# Flash loan range
MIN_LOAN_AMOUNT_USD=1000
MAX_LOAN_AMOUNT_USD=2000000

# Profit thresholds
MIN_PROFIT_USD=50
MIN_PROFIT_PERCENTAGE=0.5

# Slippage protection
MAX_SLIPPAGE_PERCENT=0.5

# Auto-execution (true/false)

```

---

## 🎯 HOW IT WORKS

### 1. Scanning (Every 2 Minutes)

The bot:
- Scans all token pairs across all DEXs
- Gets real-time prices from pool reserves
- Calculates arbitrage opportunities
- Validates liquidity and profitability

### 2. Opportunity Detection

When profitable arbitrage is found:
- Calculates optimal flash loan amount
- Estimates gas costs
- Validates net profit > $50
- Sends Telegram alert

### 3. Automatic Execution

If auto-execute is ON:
- Takes flash loan from Aave V3
- Executes buy on DEX 1
- Executes sell on DEX 2
- Repays flash loan
- Sends profit to your wallet
- Confirms on Telegram

All happens in **one atomic transaction** - either full profit or full revert!

### 4. Safety Features

- ✅ **Slippage protection** - Max 0.5% allowed
- ✅ **Gas price limits** - Won't execute if too high
- ✅ **MEV protection** - Boosted priority fees
- ✅ **Liquidity filters** - Only $5M+ pools
- ✅ **Multi-layer validation** - Price, liquidity, profit checks
- ✅ **Emergency stop** - Owner can pause anytime

---

## 💰 PROFIT CALCULATION

The bot calculates profit as:

```
Gross Profit = (Sell Price - Buy Price) × Amount
Gas Cost = Gas Used × Gas Price × ETH Price
Net Profit = Gross Profit - Gas Cost - Flash Loan Fee (0.05%)
```

Only executes if:
- Net Profit > $50
- Profit % > 0.5%
- Gas price < 0.5 gwei

## 📊 WHAT TO EXPECT

### Realistic Expectations

**Arbitrum mainnet** is highly competitive. Here's what to expect:

#### Finding Opportunities
- Scan frequency: Every 2 minutes
- Opportunities found: 0-10 per scan
- Profitable (after gas): 0-2 per scan

#### Execution Success Rate
- Attempts: 5-20 per day
- Successful: 30-60% (market dependent)
- Failed reasons: Price moved, gas too high, front-run

#### Profit Ranges
- Small profits: $50-$200 (common)
- Medium profits: $200-$500 (occasional)  
- Large profits: $500+ (rare)

#### Daily Performance
- Good day: $200-$1,000 profit
- Average day: $50-$200 profit
- Bad day: $0-$50 profit

**Important**: This bot does NOT guarantee profits. DeFi arbitrage is competitive and success depends on market conditions.

## 🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Bot not finding opportunities

**Possible reasons:**
1. Market is efficient (normal)
2. Gas prices too high
3. No price discrepancies

**Solution**: Wait and keep running. Markets fluctuate.

### Trades failing

**Possible reasons:**
1. Price moved before execution
2. Insufficient liquidity
3. Gas price spike
4. Front-running

**Solution**: Bot will retry on next scan. This is normal.

### Low profit

**Possible reasons:**
1. High competition
2. Gas costs eating profit
3. Small spreads

**Solution**: Bot only executes if profitable. Trust the algorithm.

## ⚡ OPTIMIZATION TIPS

### 1. Gas Fees
- Run during low-traffic hours
- Current gas: Check arbiscan.io
- Adjust `MAX_GAS_PRICE_GWEI` if needed

### 2. Scan Frequency
- Default: 2 minutes (120000ms)
- Faster = more opportunities but more RPC calls
- Slower = fewer opportunities but cheaper

### 3. Profit Threshold
- Default: $50 minimum
- Lower = more trades but smaller profits
- Higher = fewer trades but larger profits

### 4. Auto-Execute
- ON: Fully automated (recommended)
- OFF: Manual approval (for testing)

---

## 🔒 SECURITY

### Best Practices

1. **Never share your private key**
2. **Use a dedicated wallet** for the bot
