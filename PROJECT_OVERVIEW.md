## 📊 Token Pairs Monitored

High-liquidity pairs on Arbitrum:
- WETH/USDC, WETH/USDT, WETH/ARB

- USDC/DAI, ARB/USDT, WETH/LINK
- WETH/UNI, WETH/GMX, USDC/GMX
- WETH/MAGIC, USDC/FRAX
- **14 pairs × 3 DEXs = 42 price points scanned per cycle**

## 🔧 DEXs Integrated

1. **Uniswap V3**
   - All fee tiers: 0.01%, 0.05%, 0.3%, 1%
   - Direct quoter integration
   - Most liquid DEX on Arbitrum

2. **SushiSwap**
   - V2-style AMM
   - Good liquidity for major pairs
   - Lower fees than some competitors

3. **Camelot**
   - Native Arbitrum DEX
   - Unique tokenomics
   - Growing liquidity

## 💰 How It Makes Money

### Example Arbitrage Flow:

1. **Detect Price Difference**
   - WETH/USDC on Uniswap V3: 1 WETH = 2,000 USDC
   - WETH/USDC on SushiSwap: 1 WETH = 2,010 USDC
   - **Opportunity: 0.5% spread**

2. **Execute Flash Loan**
   ```
   1. Borrow $50,000 USDC from Aave (flash loan)
   2. Buy 25 WETH on Uniswap V3 for $50,000
   3. Sell 25 WETH on SushiSwap for $50,250
   4. Repay $50,000 + 0.09% premium = $50,045
   5. Keep profit: $205 (minus gas ~$5)
   6. Net profit: ~$200 in one transaction!
   ```

3. **All in One Atomic Transaction**
   - Can't fail partially
   - If unprofitable, transaction reverts
   - No capital risk (flash loan!)
