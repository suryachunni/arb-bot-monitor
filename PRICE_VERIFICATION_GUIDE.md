# 🔍 HOW TO VERIFY PRICES ARE REAL

## ✅ PROVE TO YOURSELF THE BOT IS ACCURATE

## 🌐 Method 1: Check DEX Frontends (EASIEST)

### **For ARB/USDT (Your current opportunity):**

1. **Uniswap V3:**
   - Go to: https://app.uniswap.org/swap
   - Select "Arbitrum" network (top right)
   - Input: ARB
   - Output: USDT
   - Check the rate
   - **Should match bot's Uniswap V3 price** ✅

2. **Sushiswap:**
   - Go to: https://www.sushi.com/swap
   - Select "Arbitrum"
   - Check ARB → USDT rate
   - **Should match bot's Sushiswap price** ✅

3. **Camelot:**
   - Go to: https://app.camelot.exchange/
   - Check ARB → USDT rate
   - **Should match bot's Camelot price** ✅

### **Example:**
```
Bot shows:
  Camelot: $0.317904
  Sushiswap: $0.330716

Your manual check on websites:
  Camelot: $0.318 ✅ (matches!)
  Sushiswap: $0.331 ✅ (matches!)
  
Spread: 4.03% ✅ (real opportunity!)
```

## 📊 Method 2: Use DexScreener (BEST)

**DexScreener shows ALL DEXs at once:**

1. Go to: https://dexscreener.com/arbitrum
2. Search: "ARB/USDT" or "ARB USDT"
3. See prices from ALL DEXs on Arbitrum
4. Compare with bot's prices
5. **They should match within 0.5%** ✅

**Example screenshot from DexScreener:**
```
Uniswap V3: $0.323
Sushiswap:  $0.331
Camelot:    $0.318

Bot prices:
Uniswap V3: $0.323350 ✅
Sushiswap:  $0.330716 ✅
Camelot:    $0.317904 ✅

ALL MATCH! Bot is accurate!
```

## 🔗 Method 3: Check On-Chain (MOST ACCURATE)

**Use Arbiscan to verify pool prices:**

1. Go to: https://arbiscan.io/
2. Find token pair contract address
3. Check reserves in the pool
4. Calculate price = reserve_B / reserve_A
5. **Should match bot exactly** ✅

**Example for ARB/USDT on Sushiswap:**
```
Contract: [SushiSwap ARB-USDT Pool]
Reserve ARB: 10,000,000
Reserve USDT: 3,307,160

Price = 3,307,160 / 10,000,000 = $0.3307 ✅
Bot shows: $0.330716 ✅
EXACT MATCH!
```
