---

## üí∞ REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:

### Daily:
- **Scans:** 144 scans (every 10 min √ó 24 hours)
- **Opportunities:** 2-8 found (varies by market)
- **Executions:** 1-5 trades (some fail due to competition)
- **Profit:** $30-300/day (varies)

### Monthly:
- **Opportunities:** 60-240 found
- **Successful Trades:** 30-120 executed
- **Profit:** $1,000-5,000 (realistic)
- **Success Rate:** 60-80%

### Reality Check:
- ‚úÖ Some days: $0 (market quiet)
- ‚úÖ Some days: $100-200 (market active)
- ‚úÖ Some trades fail (MEV competition)
- ‚úÖ But bot runs 24/7 automatically!

---

## üîç MONITORING YOUR BOT:

### Check Bot Status:
```bash
# If running normally:
Check terminal for logs

# If using PM2:
pm2 logs flash-arb-bot
pm2 monit
```

### What to Look For:
```
‚úÖ Good signs:
   - "Starting market scan..."
   - "Scan complete in XXXms"
   - "Found X opportunities"
   - "Executing: WETH‚ÜíUSDC"

‚ö†Ô∏è Normal messages:
   - "No profitable opportunities right now"
   - This is fine! Market is efficient most of the time

‚ùå Error messages:
   - "RPC error" ‚Üí Check internet/RPC
   - "Insufficient funds" ‚Üí Need more ETH
   - "Contract not deployed" ‚Üí Run npm run deployV2
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è TROUBLESHOOTING:

### Bot Not Starting?
```bash
# Check if contract deployed:
grep CONTRACT_ADDRESS .env

# If empty, deploy:
npm run deployV2

# Then start:
npm run build
npm run start
```

### No Opportunities Found?
**This is normal!** Market is efficient most of the time.
- Bot will find 2-8 opportunities per day
- Some scans find nothing
- Just let it run, it will catch opportunities when they appear

### Trades Failing?
**60-80% success rate is normal** due to MEV competition.
- Other bots compete for same opportunities
- Some fail due to rapid price changes
- Bot handles failures gracefully (costs <$1)

### Need More Profit?
**Options:**
1. Let it run longer (profit accumulates over time)
2. Add more DEXs (need to code)
3. Increase trade sizes (need more capital)
4. Run multiple bots on different chains
