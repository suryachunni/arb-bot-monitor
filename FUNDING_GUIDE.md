## ⚠️ **COMMON MISTAKES (AVOID THESE!):**

❌ **Selecting "Ethereum" network** instead of "Arbitrum"
   → Bot won't work! Gas too expensive!

❌ **Sending to BSC, Polygon, or other networks**
   → You'll LOSE your ETH! ❌

❌ **Not checking network before confirming**
   → ALWAYS verify network = Arbitrum!

❌ **Sending less than 0.05 ETH**
   → Not enough for deployment + trades!

---

## 💰 **WHY ARBITRUM?**

✅ **Our bot runs on Arbitrum**
✅ **Gas fees are MUCH cheaper** (~$0.39 vs $40+ on mainnet!)
✅ **Faster transactions**
✅ **Same security as Ethereum**
✅ **All our DEXs are on Arbitrum** (Uniswap V3, Sushiswap)
