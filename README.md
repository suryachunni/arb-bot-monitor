cd flash-loan-arbitrage-bot
npm install
```

2. **Configure Environment**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

Update the following in `.env`:
```env
# Add your wallet private key (KEEP THIS SECRET!)
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# These are already filled:
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=7990738699:AAFfoPA4VGO_90DyQauHNiwbHnfwOTmfbgU
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=8305086804
ARBITRUM_RPC_URL=https://arb-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/wuLT9bA29g4SF1zeOlgpg
```

3. **Deploy Smart Contract**
```bash
npm run compile
npm run deploy
```

This will:
- Deploy the FlashLoanArbitrage contract to Arbitrum
- Automatically update your `.env` with the contract address
- Save deployment info to `deployment.json`

4. **Build and Start**
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. Price Scanning
The bot continuously scans token pairs across multiple DEXs every 10 seconds (configurable). It fetches real-time prices using:
- Uniswap V3 Quoter for precise quotes
- Direct router calls for V2-style DEXs
- Parallel fetching for maximum speed

### 2. Arbitrage Detection
For each token pair, the bot:
- Compares prices across all DEX combinations
- Checks both directions (A→B and B→A)
- Calculates profit after fees and gas
- Filters by minimum profit threshold

### 3. Automatic Execution
When a profitable opportunity is found:
1. **Alert** - Sends detailed alert to Telegram
2. **Verification** - Re-checks prices for accuracy
3. **Gas Check** - Ensures gas price is acceptable
4. **Execution** - Executes flash loan + arbitrage in one atomic transaction
5. **Result** - Sends success/failure notification with details

### 4. Transaction Flow
```
1. Borrow X tokens via Aave flash loan
2. Swap X tokens for Y tokens on DEX A
3. Swap Y tokens back to X tokens on DEX B
4. Repay flash loan + premium
5. Keep the profit
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Flash Loan Settings

```env
MIN_PROFIT_USD=100              # Minimum profit to execute trade
MIN_LOAN_AMOUNT_USD=50000       # Flash loan amount ($50k default)
MAX_LOAN_AMOUNT_USD=500000      # Maximum loan amount
MAX_GAS_PRICE_GWEI=0.5          # Maximum acceptable gas price
```

### Monitoring Settings

```env
SCAN_INTERVAL_MS=10000          # Scan every 10 seconds
MAX_SLIPPAGE_PERCENT=0.5        # Maximum slippage tolerance
GAS_LIMIT_MULTIPLIER=1.2        # Gas limit safety multiplier
```

### DEX Configuration

```env
ENABLE_UNISWAP_V3=true
ENABLE_SUSHISWAP=true
ENABLE_CAMELOT=true
ENABLE_BALANCER=true
ENABLE_CURVE=true
```

## 📱 Telegram Commands

Once the bot is running, use these commands:

- `/start` - Initialize bot and show welcome message
- `/status` - Check bot status and configuration
- `/balance` - View wallet balance
- `/help` - Show help information

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

1. **Private Keys**
   - Never share your private key
   - Never commit `.env` to version control
   - Use a dedicated wallet for the bot

2. **Test First**
   - Start with smaller loan amounts
   - Monitor initial trades closely
   - Gradually increase as you gain confidence

3. **Gas Management**
   - Keep ETH in wallet for gas fees
   - Set reasonable gas price limits
   - Monitor Arbitrum gas prices

4. **Risk Management**
   - Set conservative profit thresholds
   - Use slippage protection
   - Don't risk more than you can afford to lose

## 📈 Performance Tips

1. **RPC Provider**
   - Use Alchemy or Infura for best reliability
   - Consider multiple RPC endpoints for redundancy

2. **Gas Optimization**
   - The contract is heavily optimized
   - Uses EIP-1559 for dynamic pricing
   - Adds 10% priority fee for faster inclusion

3. **Scan Interval**
   - 10 seconds is recommended for balance of speed vs. rate limits
   - Can be reduced to 5s for more aggressive scanning
   - Monitor RPC rate limits

4. **Token Selection**
   - Focus on high-liquidity pairs
   - Avoid exotic tokens with low volume
   - Prefer stablecoin pairs for consistent opportunities

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Gas estimation failed"
- Price moved since detection
- Insufficient liquidity
- Gas price too low

**Solution:** Increase `GAS_LIMIT_MULTIPLIER` or `MAX_GAS_PRICE_GWEI`

### "Transaction reverted"
- Slippage exceeded
- Profit below minimum
- Front-run by MEV bot

**Solution:** Increase `MAX_SLIPPAGE_PERCENT` or use private RPC

### "Low ETH balance"
- Insufficient gas fees

**Solution:** Add more ETH to your wallet

### No opportunities found
- Market conditions not favorable
- Profit thresholds too high
- DEXs not configured

**Solution:** Lower `MIN_PROFIT_USD` or enable more DEXs
