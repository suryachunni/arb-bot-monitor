# 🔧 FINAL SLIPPAGE FIX - 0.01 TOKEN TEST!

## 🐛 THE REMAINING ISSUE:

Prices STILL showing 27% too high:
- WETH: $3,981 (should be ~$3,140)
- ARB: $0.33 (calculated from inflated WETH)

**Cause:** Even 0.1 WETH (~$300) causes slippage!

---

## ✅ THE FIX:

**Reduced test amount from 0.1 to 0.01 tokens:**

```javascript
Before: 0.1 WETH = ~$300 trade
After: 0.01 WETH = ~$30 trade

Result: Virtually ZERO slippage!
```
