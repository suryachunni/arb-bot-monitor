# 💰 DYNAMIC LOAN SIZING - $1,000 to $2,000,000

## ✅ YOUR BOT NOW HAS INTELLIGENT LOAN SIZING

The bot **automatically adjusts the flash loan amount for EACH trade** from **$1,000 to $2,000,000** based on:

---

## 🎯 HOW IT WORKS

### Each Trade Gets Custom Loan Size

The bot analyzes **5 factors** for every opportunity:

#### 1️⃣ **Pool Liquidity**
```
High liquidity ($10M+)    → Larger loans possible ($500k - $2M)
Medium liquidity ($1M+)   → Medium loans ($50k - $500k)
Low liquidity ($100k+)    → Smaller loans ($1k - $50k)
```

#### 2️⃣ **Price Spread**
```
Large spread (2%+)        → Larger loans (maximize profit)
Medium spread (0.5-2%)    → Medium loans
Small spread (<0.5%)      → Smaller loans (minimize risk)
```

#### 3️⃣ **Slippage Estimate**
```
Low slippage (<0.2%)      → Can use larger size
Medium slippage (0.2-0.4%) → Reduce size by 25%
High slippage (>0.4%)     → Reduce size by 50%
```

#### 4️⃣ **Gas Cost Efficiency**
```
Profit/Gas ratio check:
- If profit < 10x gas cost → Increase size (if possible)
- Ensures trades are worth the gas
```

#### 5️⃣ **Configuration Limits**
```
Absolute minimum: $1,000
Absolute maximum: $2,000,000
```

## 📊 EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Small Stablecoin Opportunity
```
Pair: USDC/USDT
Liquidity: $500,000
Spread: 0.35%
Slippage: 0.15%

→ Loan Size: $12,000
→ Reasoning: Low spread, medium liquidity
→ Expected Profit: $40
```

### Example 2: Medium Opportunity
```
Pair: WETH/USDC
Liquidity: $5,000,000
Spread: 0.85%
Slippage: 0.20%

→ Loan Size: $125,000
→ Reasoning: Good spread, high liquidity
→ Expected Profit: $850
```

### Example 3: Large Opportunity
```
Pair: ARB/USDC
Liquidity: $15,000,000
Spread: 2.5%
Slippage: 0.10%

→ Loan Size: $750,000
→ Reasoning: Excellent spread, very high liquidity
→ Expected Profit: $18,000
```

### Example 4: Maximum Size
```
Pair: WBTC/WETH
Liquidity: $50,000,000
Spread: 3.2%
Slippage: 0.08%

→ Loan Size: $2,000,000 (max)
→ Reasoning: Huge spread, massive liquidity
→ Expected Profit: $62,000
```

## 🎯 OPTIMIZATION LOGIC

### The bot follows this decision tree:

```
1. Calculate liquidity-based max (5% of pool)
2. Adjust for spread size (larger spread = larger loan)
3. Adjust for slippage (higher slippage = smaller loan)
4. Check gas efficiency (ensure profit > 10x gas)
5. Apply limits ($1k min, $2M max)
6. Round to nearest $1,000
```

### Result: **Each trade gets the OPTIMAL loan size**

---

## ⚙️ CONFIGURATION

### In `.env.production`:

```bash
# Loan size range (dynamically adjusted per trade)
MIN_LOAN_AMOUNT_USD=1000         # Smallest possible loan
MAX_LOAN_AMOUNT_USD=2000000      # Largest possible loan
DEFAULT_LOAN_AMOUNT_USD=50000    # Starting point
```

### What This Means:

- **Small opportunities** → Bot uses $1k-$50k
- **Medium opportunities** → Bot uses $50k-$500k
- **Large opportunities** → Bot uses $500k-$2M
- **EACH TRADE IS DIFFERENT**

---

## 📈 BENEFITS

### 1. **Maximize Profits**
- Large spreads get large loans → More profit
- Small spreads get small loans → Lower risk

### 2. **Minimize Slippage**
- Bot never exceeds 5% of pool liquidity
- Automatically reduces size if slippage too high

### 3. **Efficient Gas Usage**
- Small opportunities use small loans (don't waste gas)
- Large opportunities use large loans (maximize return)

### 4. **Risk Management**
- Never over-leverage
- Adapts to market conditions
- Protects your capital

### 5. **Capture More Opportunities**
- Can take small $1k trades (other bots skip these)
- Can take large $2M trades (maximize big opportunities)
- Everything in between

## 🎓 UNDERSTANDING THE SIZING

### Why Not Always Use Maximum?

**Bad Strategy:**
```
Every trade → $2M loan
Small opportunity (0.3% spread, $500k liquidity)
→ Massive slippage
→ Trade fails
→ Lose gas fees
```

**Smart Strategy (YOUR BOT):**
```
Small opportunity → $15k loan
Medium opportunity → $100k loan
Large opportunity → $1M loan
Huge opportunity → $2M loan

→ Each trade optimized
→ Minimal slippage
→ Maximum success rate
```
