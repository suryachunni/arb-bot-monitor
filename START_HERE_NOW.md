## ⚙️ CONFIGURATION (OPTIONAL)

All settings are in `.env` and work great by default:

```bash
# Already configured for you:
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=7990738699:AAFfoPA4VGO_90DyQauHNiwbHnfwOTmfbgU
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=8305086804
ARBITRUM_RPC_URL=https://arb-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/wuLT9bA29g4SF1zeOlgpg

# You must add:
PRIVATE_KEY=your_key_here

# Auto-filled after deploy:
ARBITRAGE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=(filled automatically)

# Optional tuning (defaults are good):
SCAN_INTERVAL_MS=120000        # 2 minutes (recommended)
MIN_PROFIT_USD=50              # Min profit after costs
MAX_GAS_PRICE_GWEI=0.5         # Max gas price
AUTO_EXECUTE=true              # Fully automated
```

**Recommendation:** Start with defaults, optimize later based on results.
