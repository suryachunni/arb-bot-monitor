## üî• BRUTALLY HONEST SUMMARY:

### ‚úÖ WHAT IS REAL:

1. **Uniswap V3 has the BEST and MOST RELIABLE prices:**
   - WETH = ~$4,008 (USDC/USDT)
   - 1 WETH = 12,302 ARB
   - 1 ARB = $0.3256
   - All prices are LIVE and REAL ‚úÖ

2. **SushiSwap has SOME liquidity:**
   - WETH/ARB: $680M+ (excellent!)
   - WETH/USDT: $73k (OK for small trades)
   - WETH/USDC: $61k (OK for small trades)

3. **Camelot mostly has LOW liquidity:**
   - Most pools have <$1,000
   - Not suitable for real trading
   - Prices are distorted

---

### ‚ùå WHAT IS FAKE:

1. **Those HUGE spreads (2289%, 1128%, etc.):**
   - ‚ùå NOT real opportunities
   - ‚ùå From pools with $0-$1,000 liquidity
   - ‚ùå Can't actually trade these
   - ‚ùå Would get 99% slippage

2. **Why they show up:**
   - Pools exist but are empty/abandoned
   - Prices are stale or manipulated
   - No arbitrageurs to align prices
   - Bot CORRECTLY filters these out

---

## üí° REAL ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES?

### Looking at TRADEABLE pairs only:

**WETH/ARB (Best opportunity):**
```
Uniswap V3: 12,302 ARB per WETH
SushiSwap:  11,671 ARB per WETH ($680M liquidity!)
Camelot:    11,072 ARB per WETH ($330M liquidity!)

Spread: ~5-11%
BUT: Likely price artifacts from low-test amounts
Real spread: Probably <0.5% for large trades
```

**WETH/USDC:**
```
Uniswap V3: $4,008.87
SushiSwap:  $3,749.55 (only $61k liquidity)

Spread: ~6.5%
BUT: SushiSwap liquidity too low
Real tradeable spread: ~0% (can't get this price on volume)
```

**WETH/USDT:**
```
Uniswap V3: $4,007.55
SushiSwap:  $3,786.39 ($73k liquidity)

Spread: ~5.5%
BUT: Again, low liquidity
Real tradeable spread: ~0%
```
