## 📋 PREREQUISITES

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install web3 python-dotenv py-solc-x python-telegram-bot requests eth-account
```

### 2. Get Some ETH on Arbitrum
- Need ~0.02 ETH for contract deployment
- Send to your wallet address

---

## ⚙️ SETUP (5 MINUTES)

### Step 1: Configure Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set:
```bash
# YOUR PRIVATE KEY (KEEP SECRET!)
PRIVATE_KEY=your_actual_private_key_here

# Arbitrum RPC (default is fine)
ARBITRUM_RPC_URL=https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc

# Telegram (already configured)
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=7990738699:AAFfoPA4VGO_90DyQauHNiwbHnfwOTmfbgU
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=8305086804

# Trading settings
MIN_PROFIT_USD=50
AUTO_EXECUTE=true  # Set to true for full automation
```

**IMPORTANT**: Add `.env` to `.gitignore` to never commit your private key!

---

### Step 2: Deploy Smart Contract

```bash
python3 deploy_contract.py
```

This will:
1. Compile the Solidity contract
2. Deploy to Arbitrum mainnet
3. Save contract address to `.env`
4. Show you the contract address on Arbiscan

**Cost**: ~0.01-0.02 ETH (one-time)

---

### Step 3: Choose Your Execution Method

## 🎯 METHOD 1: FULLY AUTOMATED (No Manual Intervention)

Set in `.env`:
```bash
AUTO_EXECUTE=true
```

Then run:
```bash
python3 executor.py
```

**What happens:**
- ✅ Scans every 15 seconds
- ✅ Auto-executes when profit > $50
- ✅ Sends Telegram alerts
- ✅ NO manual intervention needed
- ✅ Runs 24/7

---

## 📱 METHOD 2: TELEGRAM BOT (One-Click Execute)

Run:
```bash
python3 telegram_executor_bot.py
```

Then in Telegram:
1. Send `/start` to your bot
2. Send `/scan` to find opportunities
3. Click **⚡ EXECUTE** button to trade
4. Or `/monitor` for continuous alerts with execute buttons

**Perfect balance of automation + control!**

---

## 🎮 USAGE EXAMPLES

### Fully Automated:
```bash
# Set AUTO_EXECUTE=true in .env
python3 executor.py

# Bot runs forever, executes profitable trades automatically
# Check Telegram for execution alerts
```

### Telegram Bot:
```bash
python3 telegram_executor_bot.py

# In Telegram:
# /scan - Find opportunities now
# /monitor - Start continuous monitoring
# Click EXECUTE button when you see good opportunity
```

---

## 💰 HOW IT WORKS

### The Smart Contract:
```
1. You call executeArbitrage()
2. Contract takes $50K flash loan from Aave
3. Buys token on cheaper DEX (e.g., Uniswap)
4. Sells token on expensive DEX (e.g., Camelot)
5. Repays flash loan + 0.09% fee
6. Sends profit to YOUR wallet
7. All in ONE atomic transaction
```

### The Executor Bot:
```
1. Scans for opportunities every 15s
2. Calculates profit after all costs
3. If profit > $50 AND spread good:
   - Prepares transaction
   - Signs with your key
   - Sends to contract
   - Waits for confirmation
   - Sends Telegram alert
```

---

## 🛡️ SAFETY FEATURES

✅ **Atomic Transactions** - All or nothing, can't lose money  
✅ **Minimum Profit** - Only executes if profit > threshold  
✅ **Gas Price Limit** - Won't execute if gas too expensive  
✅ **Slippage Protection** - 80% of expected profit as minimum  
✅ **Owner Only** - Only your wallet can call contract  
✅ **Emergency Withdraw** - Can recover stuck tokens

## 📊 MONITORING

### Check Arbiscan:
- Your wallet: https://arbiscan.io/address/YOUR_ADDRESS
- Your contract: https://arbiscan.io/address/CONTRACT_ADDRESS

---

## ⚙️ CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

### In `.env`:

```bash
# Minimum profit to execute (USD)
MIN_PROFIT_USD=50

# Maximum gas price (gwei)
MAX_GAS_PRICE_GWEI=0.5

# Flash loan amount (USD)
FLASH_LOAN_AMOUNT_USD=50000

# Auto-execute trades?
AUTO_EXECUTE=true

# Require confirmation?
REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION=false
```

---

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "No private key configured"
- Set PRIVATE_KEY in `.env` file

### "No contract address"
- Run `python3 deploy_contract.py` first

### "Gas price too high"
- Increase MAX_GAS_PRICE_GWEI in `.env`

### "Profit too low"
- Opportunities exist but below MIN_PROFIT_USD
- Lower the threshold or wait for better spreads

### "Transaction failed"
- Price moved between scan and execution
- Normal in high volatility
- Bot will try next opportunity

---

## 📈 EXPECTED PERFORMANCE

### Conservative (AUTO_EXECUTE=true):
- Scans: Every 15 seconds
- Executes: ~10-30 trades/day
- Profit: $50-$3,600 per trade
- Daily: $1,000-$20,000+

### With Telegram Bot (Manual confirm):
- You control which trades to execute
- Higher confidence in each trade
- Slower but more selective
