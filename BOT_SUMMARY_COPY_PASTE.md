# Flash Loan Arbitrage Bot - Complete Summary

## üéØ WHAT OUR BOT CAN DO

### Core Capabilities
‚Ä¢ Automatically scans 10 token pairs on Arbitrum mainnet for price differences between Uniswap V3 and SushiSwap
‚Ä¢ Detects profitable arbitrage opportunities in real-time (scans every 2 seconds)
‚Ä¢ Executes flash loan arbitrage trades automatically without manual intervention
‚Ä¢ Borrows $50,000 via flash loan, trades across DEXs, repays loan, and sends profit to wallet - all in one atomic transaction
‚Ä¢ Executes trades in under 1 second from detection to completion
‚Ä¢ Scans bidirectionally (A‚ÜíB and B‚ÜíA) for double the opportunities
‚Ä¢ Filters out unprofitable trades to protect capital
‚Ä¢ Sends detailed alerts to Telegram for every opportunity and execution
‚Ä¢ Can be controlled remotely via Telegram commands (pause, resume, stop)
‚Ä¢ Runs 24/7 without human intervention when deployed on VPS
‚Ä¢ Automatically calculates exact slippage by reading actual pool reserves
‚Ä¢ Protects against MEV attacks using priority fees
‚Ä¢ Handles gas optimization automatically
‚Ä¢ Recovers from errors and continues operating
