## üéØ SCANNING STRATEGY:

Your bot does this EVERY 10 MINUTES:

```
1. Get WETH price from Uniswap V3 & SushiSwap
2. Get ARB price from Uniswap V3 & SushiSwap
3. Get USDC price from Uniswap V3 & SushiSwap
4. Get USDT price from Uniswap V3 & SushiSwap
5. Get WBTC price from Uniswap V3 & SushiSwap
6. Get LINK price from Uniswap V3 & SushiSwap

For each pair:
‚îú‚îÄ Check liquidity (must be >$50k)
‚îú‚îÄ Calculate spread between DEXs
‚îú‚îÄ Estimate slippage
‚îú‚îÄ Calculate net profit
‚îî‚îÄ Alert if profitable (>$50)
```

## üí° SHOULD WE ADD/CHANGE TOKENS?

### Currently Using: ‚úÖ GOOD SELECTION
- WETH ‚úÖ (best)
- ARB ‚úÖ (best)
- USDC ‚úÖ (necessary)
- USDT ‚úÖ (backup)
- WBTC ‚úÖ (high value)
- LINK ‚úÖ (diversification)

### Could Add (if you want):

**High Potential:**
- **GMX** (0xfc5A1A6EB076a2C7aD06eD22C90d7E710E35ad0a)
  - Gaming token, high volatility
  - Good liquidity
  - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

- **PENDLE** (0x0c880f6761F1af8d9Aa9C466984b80DAb9a8c9e8)
  - DeFi token, volatile
  - Medium liquidity
  - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Lower Priority:**
- DAI (another stablecoin - not needed)
- USDC.e (bridged USDC - confusing)

---

## üî• MY RECOMMENDATION:

### CURRENT SETUP: ‚úÖ EXCELLENT

**Best Pairs (Keep Focus):**
1. WETH/ARB ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (YOUR BEST OPPORTUNITY)
2. WETH/USDC ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
3. ARB/USDC ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Can Remove (Low Value):**
- WETH/WBTC (low liquidity)
- WETH/LINK (low opportunities)
- WETH/USDT (duplicate of WETH/USDC)

### OPTIMIZED SETUP (Recommended):

**Focus on 3 HIGH-QUALITY pairs:**
1. WETH/ARB ($680M liquidity!)
2. WETH/USDC (most reliable)
3. ARB/USDC (volatile)

This gives you:
- ‚úÖ Best liquidity
- ‚úÖ Highest volatility
- ‚úÖ Most opportunities
- ‚úÖ Faster scanning
