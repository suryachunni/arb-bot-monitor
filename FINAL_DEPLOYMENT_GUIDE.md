## 🎯 EXPECTED PERFORMANCE

### Scanning
- **Frequency:** Every 2 minutes (720 scans/day)
- **Speed:** 1-2 seconds per scan
- **Pairs:** 19+ token pairs
- **DEXs:** 3+ DEXs per pair
- **Total checks:** 50+ price points per scan

### Opportunities
- **Found:** 0-50 per day (market dependent)
- **Profitable:** 0-10 per day after gas
- **Success rate:** 30-60% execution

### Profits
- **Small:** $50-$200 (common)
- **Medium:** $200-$500 (occasional)
- **Large:** $500+ (rare)
- **Daily:** $50-$1,000 (market dependent)

**Note:** DeFi arbitrage is competitive. Profits depend on market conditions, gas prices, and competition.

---

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Contract address not configured"
**Solution:** Run `npm run deploy` first

### "Insufficient ETH for gas"
**Solution:** Add ETH to your wallet (0.05 ETH recommended)

### "Configuration validation failed"
**Solution:** Check `.env` file - ensure PRIVATE_KEY is set

### "No opportunities found"
**Solution:** This is normal! Markets are efficient. Keep running.

### "Trades failing"
**Solution:** Normal in competitive markets. Bot will retry.

### "Gas price too high"
**Solution:** Wait for lower gas prices or increase MAX_GAS_PRICE_GWEI

---

## 📈 OPTIMIZATION TIPS

### 1. Scan Frequency
```bash
# Faster scanning (more RPC calls, more opportunities)
SCAN_INTERVAL_MS=60000    # 1 minute

# Slower scanning (fewer RPC calls, fewer opportunities)
SCAN_INTERVAL_MS=300000   # 5 minutes

# Default (recommended)
SCAN_INTERVAL_MS=120000   # 2 minutes
```

### 2. Profit Threshold
```bash
# Lower threshold (more trades, smaller profits)
MIN_PROFIT_USD=25

# Higher threshold (fewer trades, larger profits)
MIN_PROFIT_USD=100

# Default (recommended)
MIN_PROFIT_USD=50
```

### 3. Auto-Execution
```bash
# Fully automated (recommended for production)
AUTO_EXECUTE=true

# Manual approval (good for testing)
AUTO_EXECUTE=false
```

## 🎓 UNDERSTANDING THE SYSTEM

### Flash Loan Flow
```
1. Opportunity detected
2. Calculate optimal loan amount
3. Take flash loan from Aave V3
4. Buy token on DEX1 (cheaper)
5. Sell token on DEX2 (expensive)
6. Repay flash loan + 0.05% fee
7. Keep profit
8. All in ONE atomic transaction
```

### Arbitrage Types

**Direct (Bidirectional):**
```
WETH → USDC (buy on Uniswap V3)
USDC → WETH (sell on SushiSwap)
Profit = Price difference - Costs
```

**Triangular:**
```
WETH → USDC → ARB → WETH
Profit = Compounded price differences - Costs
```

### Profit Calculation
```
Gross Profit = (Sell Price - Buy Price) × Amount
Flash Loan Fee = 0.05% × Loan Amount
Gas Cost = Gas Used × Gas Price × ETH Price
Net Profit = Gross Profit - Flash Loan Fee - Gas Cost

Only executes if Net Profit > $50
```
