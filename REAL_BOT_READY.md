# 1. Your wallet already has private key set
# 2. Fund with 0.02 ETH on Arbitrum
# 3. Deploy contract (if not deployed)
npm run deployV2

# 4. Start bot
npm run build
node dist/index-real-bot.js

# Bot will:
# - Start scanning every 10 minutes

```

### Option 2: PM2 (24/7 Operation)

npm run build
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --name flash-arb-bot

```

### Option 3: VPS (Best)

```bash
# On your VPS (DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.)
git clone <your-repo>
cd flash-loan-arbitrage
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your keys
