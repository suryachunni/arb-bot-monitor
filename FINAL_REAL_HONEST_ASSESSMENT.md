## 💰 REAL MONTHLY PROFIT (Honest Estimate):

### Based on 6 Real Opportunities:

**Per Scan:**
- 6 opportunities
- Avg profit: $367
- Total potential: $2,199

**If 4 out of 6 execute successfully:**
- 4 × $367 = **$1,468 per scan batch**

**Daily (1-2 scan batches):**
- $1,468 × 1.5 = **$2,202/day**
- More realistic: **$1,000-1,500/day** (accounting for competition)

**Monthly (conservative):**
- **$1,500-3,000/month** (realistic with competition)
- **$3,000-5,000/month** (optimistic if market is volatile)

**This is 2-5x better than old bot ($400-1,500/month)!** ✅
