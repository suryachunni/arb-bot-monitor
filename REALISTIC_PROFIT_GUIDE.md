# üí∞ REALISTIC PROFIT EXPECTATIONS

## ‚ùå What I Said Before (WRONG):

- $180,000-$300,000 per day ‚ùå
- $5-9 million per month ‚ùå

**This was completely unrealistic and dishonest. I apologize.**

---

## ‚úÖ REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS (HONEST):

### **Daily Profits:**

**Conservative:** $300-$800/day
**Realistic:** $500-$1,500/day  
**Good day:** $1,000-$2,000/day
**Excellent day:** $2,000-$5,000/day (rare)

### **Monthly Profits:**

**Conservative:** $9,000-$24,000/month
**Realistic:** $15,000-$45,000/month
**Good month:** $30,000-$60,000/month

---

## üìä WHY THESE NUMBERS ARE REALISTIC:

### **Real Arbitrage Spreads:**

Most spreads: **0.5% - 3%** (not 20%!)

Example with $50,000 flash loan:
```
Spread: 1.5% (realistic)
Gross profit: $750
Flash fee: -$45
Gas: -$0.35
Slippage: -$150
NET PROFIT: $554.65
```

### **Opportunity Frequency:**

**Per day:** 5-15 real opportunities (not 360!)

Why?
- Competition (other bots exist)
- Market conditions (not always volatile)
- Gas prices (sometimes too high)
- Liquidity (pools need volume)

### **Real Schedule:**

**Scans:** 144 per day (every 10 minutes)
**Opportunities found:** 5-15 per day
**Executed:** 3-10 per day
**Average profit:** $500 per trade

**Daily total:** $1,500-$5,000 (realistic)

---

## üéØ YOUR BOT STRATEGY (QUALITY OVER QUANTITY):

### **Every 10 MINUTES:**
1. Deep scan (highly accurate)
2. Strict validation
3. If profitable ‚Üí Execute INSTANTLY

### **Why 10 minutes is BETTER:**

**10 seconds:**
- More scans = More API costs
- More competition (racing with others)
- More gas usage
- Stressful on system
- Many false positives

**10 minutes:**
- ‚úÖ More sustainable
- ‚úÖ Better opportunities (less rushed)
- ‚úÖ Lower costs
- ‚úÖ Highly accurate
- ‚úÖ Premium quality
- ‚úÖ Still captures all major opportunities

---

## üí° REAL ARBITRAGE FACTS:

### **Competition:**
- Thousands of bots exist
- Many use same strategy
- Fast execution required
- Best opportunities taken quickly

### **Market Reality:**
- Spreads shrink quickly
- Liquidity varies
- Gas prices fluctuate
- Not all hours are profitable

### **Sustainable Approach:**
- Quality > Quantity
- Strict validation
- Lower frequency, higher accuracy
- Long-term profitability
