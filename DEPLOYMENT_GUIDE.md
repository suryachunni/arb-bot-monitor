# 🚀 DEPLOYMENT GUIDE - You Have 2 Options

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: You NEED a Computer Running 24/7

**Your mobile phone is NOT enough!** Here's why:

### Why Mobile Won't Work:
- ❌ Can't run Node.js code
- ❌ Bot needs to run continuously (24/7)
- ❌ Will stop when phone sleeps
- ❌ Can't execute trades

### What You NEED:

---

## 💻 OPTION A: Your Laptop/Desktop (Free, but...)

### Pros:
- ✅ Free (no monthly cost)
- ✅ Full control
- ✅ Easy to setup

### Cons:
- ❌ Must leave computer on 24/7
- ❌ High electricity cost
- ❌ If computer sleeps/restarts, bot stops
- ❌ Internet must be stable
- ❌ Misses opportunities when off

### How to Setup:

**1. Install Node.js on your computer:**
- Windows: Download from https://nodejs.org/
