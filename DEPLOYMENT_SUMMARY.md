- **Auto-restart**: No (restart manually if stopped)

---

## 📋 Management Commands

### View Live Logs
```bash
tail -f /workspace/monitor.log
```

### Check Process Status
```bash
ps aux | grep weth_price_monitor.py
```

### Stop Monitor
```bash
pkill -f weth_price_monitor.py
```

### Restart Monitor
```bash
cd /workspace
nohup python3 -u weth_price_monitor.py > monitor.log 2>&1 &
```

### Or use the helper script:
```bash
./run_monitor.sh
```

---

## 🔍 Verify It's Working

1. **Check Telegram**: You should have received 2 messages:
   - Startup confirmation
   - First price alert

2. **Check Logs**:
   ```bash
   tail -20 /workspace/monitor.log
   ```

3. **Run Test Script**:
   ```bash
   python3 test_setup.py
   ```

## 📈 Understanding the Data

### Price Differences
- **Normal spread**: 0.1% - 0.5% between major DEXs
- **Arbitrage opportunity**: >0.5% spread
- **High opportunity**: >1% spread (rare, but possible)

### Why Prices Differ
1. **Liquidity**: Lower liquidity = higher slippage
2. **Fee tiers**: Uniswap V3's different fees = different prices
3. **Trading volume**: Active pairs have tighter spreads
4. **MEV bots**: Keep major pairs closely aligned

### Camelot Anomaly
The Camelot price (~$167) is likely because:
- Low direct WETH/USDC liquidity
- Router finding inefficient path
- Or the pair doesn't exist (routing through multiple hops)

**Recommendation**: Focus on Uniswap V3 and SushiSwap for reliable prices.

## ⚠️ Trading Considerations

Before executing arbitrage:

1. **Gas Costs**: Arbitrum is cheap (~$0.01-0.05/tx) but still a factor
2. **Slippage**: Quoted prices are for 1 WETH - large trades will have slippage
3. **Speed**: Prices change quickly - be ready to act fast
4. **Capital**: Need capital on both DEXs for true arbitrage
5. **MEV**: Bots are watching - they might front-run you

### Profitable Spread Formula
```
Profitable Spread = (Gas Costs × 2 + Desired Profit) / Trade Size

For Arbitrum with $10 profit target on 1 WETH:
Required Spread ≈ ($0.10 + $10) / $4000 = 0.25%
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. ✅ **Monitor is running** - Check your Telegram for alerts
2. ✅ **Prices arriving every 3 minutes** - First alert already sent  
3. 🔜 **Wait for opportunities** - Look for spreads >0.5%
4. 🔜 **Verify on DEX** - Always double-check before trading
5. 🔜 **Execute trades** - When you find profitable arbitrage

---

## 🛠️ Advanced Setup (Optional)

### Run as System Service
For production deployment with auto-restart:

```bash
sudo cp weth-monitor.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable weth-monitor
sudo systemctl start weth-monitor
sudo systemctl status weth-monitor
```

### Docker Deployment
For containerized deployment:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f
```

---

## 📞 Support & Monitoring

### Log Monitoring
```bash
# Watch logs in real-time
tail -f monitor.log

# Check for errors
grep -i error monitor.log

# Check success rate
grep -c "Telegram message sent successfully" monitor.log
```

### Health Checks
The monitor will automatically:
- Retry on connection failures
- Send error alerts to Telegram
